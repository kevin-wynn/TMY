Standing ovation for the music on this one. Zimmer YOU KILLED IT.\r\n\r\nSecond off let me preface this with 2 things... I HATE superman, I think he\'s a terrible designed superhero and I don\'t know how he became some popular. Secondly, I LOVE dark movies.\r\n\r\nSo, with those beings said, I\'d give it more stars if I could, I mean I could... But I\'m going to adhere to my own policies and rules with this one. Restraint.\r\n\r\nThis movie was amazing. The music was so good, the cinematography... You could cut 5 seconds out of ANY period of this movie and make a trailer out of it, it was shot BEAUTIFULLY and it looks unreal its so good... Ben you got HUGE for this role too, wow. I mean theres like a 5 minute long cut of him working out and training to beat Superman\'s ass, I could loop that section over and over and get all my workout motivation needed.\r\n\r\nAlso I came to this thinking ehh okay, I mean, don\'t pick a fight with superman you\'ll lose, its superman, he\'s a terrible superhero.\r\n\r\nBut holy shit Batman fucking whooped his ass all over the place. I mean Superman holy shit you got your ass HANDED to you. Batman fucking bonked your ass around so good. And I LOVE that out of all this, he made you bleed. You suck Superman, Batman forever!\r\n\r\nAnywho, lets continue.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry ladies, but unfortunately the battle grounds not looking good for you anymore. Because Wonder Woman stepped up to the plate and I\'m swiping right on her so hard. I love how she\'s all ehh no I don\'t wanna get involved count me out, no way. But then she comes out of nowhere like alright dude, fuck off, I\'m here to save the day.\r\n\r\nOkay Superman here it is for you, your just reward. You should have stayed dead.\r\n\r\nAnyways back on topic, this is getting long. Snyder I love you man, you shoot some incredible stuff. I mean its unreal. I just wish two things from this movie, I wish you had shaved whats his face\'s hair long ago. Jesse seemed to only really step into Luther\'s character until the last few minutes! Whip him in shape if he\'s coming back. Also, your introduction of all the other Justice League characters, felt a little forced, and a little weird. But I get it, you just kind of wanted a hint you don\'t wanna give the whole meal at once. Back to Batman right, I get chu.\r\n\r\nBatman vs Superman, more like Batman whipped up on Superman and left me in awe and anxious for the next one.\r\n\r\nAffleck I love you.', '2016-03-23', '2016-04-09 16:21:37', 1, '5.8', 'Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIGtF3J5kn8'),

Someone pinch me\"\r\n\r\nI wasn\'t wrong either. This movie had a nice lead into everything, it was well crafted. I felt like it wasn\'t really going for just a shock factor but it was rather actually trying to convey a story. I liked that, it was a nice relief after watching just countless of mind numbing horror movies where the only thing scary is the lack of development in characters, plot, story, etc.\r\n\r\nThis movie does have a bit of a gore factor, being from the same studio who did Human Centipede can you go into it thinking about that?\r\n\r\nI like movies where the horror to them is something tangible, something that could actually happen. Getting into an accident and winding up in a backwoods showdown with some pretty wild characters who haven\'t become euthanized by society.\r\n\r\nOverall this is a good watch, it\'s enjoyable, its got a gore factor, and also a chilling paranoia factor being so dark and only seeing what the flashlight beam is willing to show.

The monster looks great, but I think could have been scarier. In the sense of making the movie about survival, monster and human alike.
