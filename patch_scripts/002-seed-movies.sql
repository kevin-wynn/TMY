Standing ovation for the music on this one. Zimmer YOU KILLED IT.\r\n\r\nSecond off let me preface this with 2 things... I HATE superman, I think he\'s a terrible designed superhero and I don\'t know how he became some popular. Secondly, I LOVE dark movies.\r\n\r\nSo, with those beings said, I\'d give it more stars if I could, I mean I could... But I\'m going to adhere to my own policies and rules with this one. Restraint.\r\n\r\nThis movie was amazing. The music was so good, the cinematography... You could cut 5 seconds out of ANY period of this movie and make a trailer out of it, it was shot BEAUTIFULLY and it looks unreal its so good... Ben you got HUGE for this role too, wow. I mean theres like a 5 minute long cut of him working out and training to beat Superman\'s ass, I could loop that section over and over and get all my workout motivation needed.\r\n\r\nAlso I came to this thinking ehh okay, I mean, don\'t pick a fight with superman you\'ll lose, its superman, he\'s a terrible superhero.\r\n\r\nBut holy shit Batman fucking whooped his ass all over the place. I mean Superman holy shit you got your ass HANDED to you. Batman fucking bonked your ass around so good. And I LOVE that out of all this, he made you bleed. You suck Superman, Batman forever!\r\n\r\nAnywho, lets continue.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry ladies, but unfortunately the battle grounds not looking good for you anymore. Because Wonder Woman stepped up to the plate and I\'m swiping right on her so hard. I love how she\'s all ehh no I don\'t wanna get involved count me out, no way. But then she comes out of nowhere like alright dude, fuck off, I\'m here to save the day.\r\n\r\nOkay Superman here it is for you, your just reward. You should have stayed dead.\r\n\r\nAnyways back on topic, this is getting long. Snyder I love you man, you shoot some incredible stuff. I mean its unreal. I just wish two things from this movie, I wish you had shaved whats his face\'s hair long ago. Jesse seemed to only really step into Luther\'s character until the last few minutes! Whip him in shape if he\'s coming back. Also, your introduction of all the other Justice League characters, felt a little forced, and a little weird. But I get it, you just kind of wanted a hint you don\'t wanna give the whole meal at once. Back to Batman right, I get chu.\r\n\r\nBatman vs Superman, more like Batman whipped up on Superman and left me in awe and anxious for the next one.\r\n\r\nAffleck I love you.', '2016-03-23', '2016-04-09 16:21:37', 1, '5.8', 'Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIGtF3J5kn8'),

Pitts character Bishop falls into the hands of China after a rescue op gone wrong. And as he\'s walking out the door for retirement, Redford\'s character Muir picks up wind of his boys situation and agrees to hold back for the day to help him out.\r\n\r\nRedford does a great job of twisting the scene to his will, he\'s always moving 5 steps ahead of everyone else to save his boy Pitt. Retelling one of the best spy stories I\'ve seen on screen yet.\r\n\r\nHe\'s a storyteller and a wonderful one at that. This movie sits at the top of all spy movies for sure. It holds me for its story and its action. The balance between shifting the scene with Redford and Pitt is amazing.', '2001-11-18', '2016-04-09 17:35:23', 0, '6.4', 'Action, Crime, Thriller', '');
